In the third installment of the "Adventures in the LSPECTROniverse" series made for LSPECTR-OS, Adrien's world takes an unexpected turn as he navigates through a week filled with challenges and setbacks. From dodging the antics of his haters attempting to trip him to facing delays in getting his PC back and dealing with a broken school iPad, Adrien finds himself grappling with unexpected hurdles.

As he approaches his 14th birthday, Adrien decides to shake off the negativity by planning a unique family vacation. Utilizing a groundbreaking invention he's been working on—a time-travel device—he sets his sights on revisiting the year 2022, a period he cherishes as one of the best years of his life. In this bygone era, he dreams of reliving carefree moments, being able to read books gifted to Julien by his late cousin Patrick (whose unfortunate neglect by a hospital on that fateful last day on 2022 still haunts Adrien) without Julien screaming at him to "be careful not to rip it or his memory will be dishonored", and reclaiming the sense of empowerment from dominating his summer STEM program with his coding prowess. Most of all, he yearns to reconnect with Patrick, whose memory holds a special place in his heart.

However, Adrien's plans take a dramatic turn when the legendary Omniscience, a notorious criminal mastermind that claims to know everything, intervenes to alter events in 2022. This interference triggers a catastrophic glitch in the fabric of the universe's timeline, throwing Adrien into a high-stakes adventure where he must confront the consequences of tampering with the past. Will Adrien unravel the mystery behind Omniscience's motives and restore balance to the disrupted timeline, or will he be swept away in a whirlwind of unforeseen consequences? Join Adrien on a thrilling journey filled with nostalgia, suspense, and the quest for redemption in "The Summer of 2022."
