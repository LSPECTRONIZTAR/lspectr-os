LSPECTR-OS is an innovative and completely experimental executable application that brings a unique blend of entertainment and functionality to your Windows PC and/or Mac. It's important to note that LSPECTR-OS is not an actual operating system but rather a feature-rich application designed to enhance your digital experience.

In short, it's just a stupid test I came up with to see if it's possible to make an actual OS similar to gaming consoles like PS4 on a Scratch mod. Let's see how it goes...

## Features

- **Gaming Experience**: Play your favorite LSPECTROniverse games directly within LSPECTR-OS, eliminating the hassle of constantly switching between applications for convenience.
- **Multimedia Content**: Enjoy a variety of entertainment options, including YouTube videos and animations (specifically the ones created by [the developer](https://github.com/LSPECTRONIZTAR)).
- **Reading Material**: While I didn't have my PC, I spent my time making random novels and stories, but I figured I might as well share my work with others if I was going to work that hard on them. So I added a reading feature for no good reason.
- **Privacy Assurance**: LSPECTR-OS prioritizes your privacy and security. It does not share your personal information publicly, ensuring a safe and secure environment.

## Installation

To install LSPECTR-OS, simply download the executable file from our [Game Jolt page](https://gamejolt.com/games/lspectr-os/836989) or from the GitHub repository and follow the on-screen instructions.

## What LSPECTR-OS Can Do

- Provide a seamless gaming experience within the application.
- Offer a wide range of multimedia content, including YouTube videos and animations.
- Present engaging novels and random stories I made for your reading pleasure.

## What LSPECTR-OS Cannot Do

- Stick out its gyat(t) for the rizzler (sorry, Gen Alphas!).

## Planned Features

- Voice chat (only that would require storing passwords into global Game Jolt data and I don't want to take risks)

## Requirements
- Your device needs to be able to view PDFs in iframe, otherwise you can't read books. Sorry.
- LSPECTR-OS is not compatible with Chromebooks, because:
  - I would have to make it into an `.html` as Chromebooks can neither run `.dmg` or `.exe` files, and therefore, the only way to use it on Chromebooks is to run it as an `.html`. Then people will try to run it on mobile devices (since `.html`s work anywhere) and get frustrated upon finding out that LSPECTR-OS isn't compatible with mobile devices either.
  - Chromebooks are *extremely* slow (not all Chromebooks, but the fastest ones probably aren't even fast enough for LSPECTR-OS to run properly).
