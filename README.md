LSPECTR-OS is a completely experimental executable application that brings a unique blend of entertainment and functionality to your Windows PC and/or Mac. I started working on this to see if it's possible to make an actual all-in-one gaming OS similar to the likes of a PS5 or something, all using a Scratch mod, so let's see how it goes...

## Installation

This app is currently unavailable, as I have not finished the beta build yet.

## What it can do

- **Game Launcher:** Can launch any game directly in the app (as long as it's from a website).
- **Book Launcher:** Can read any PDF directly in the app (work-in-progress).

## What it cannot do

- **Brainrot:** Cannot stick out its gyat(t) for the rizzler (sorry, Gen Alphas!).

## Planned features

- **Voice Chat**

## Requirements
- Your device must be a Windows PC and/or Mac. LSPECTR-OS is not compatible with Chromebooks, because then I would have to make it into an .html as Chromebooks can neither run .dmg or .exe files, and therefore, the only way to use it on Chromebooks is to run it as an .html. Then people will try to run it on mobile devices (since .htmls work anywhere) and get frustrated upon finding out that LSPECTR-OS isn't compatible with mobile devices either. Plus, Chromebooks are *extremely* slow (not all Chromebooks, but the fastest ones probably aren't even fast enough for LSPECTR-OS to run properly).

## Acknowledgments

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the people whose libraries made LSPECTR-OS possible:
- **PenguinMod**: A mod of TurboWarp (which is a mod of Scratch) that was used to create LSPECTR-OS. Visit the [PenguinMod Studio](https://studio.penguinmod.com) for more information.
- **GarboMuffin**: The creator of TurboWarp. For a comprehensive list of custom extensions used in LSPECTR-OS, visit the [TurboWarp Extensions Repository](https://extensions.turbowarp.org).
